## Date Table
The date table contains all necessary information about dates, such as weekday, week number, quarter as well as start- and end day of the week. 
The table can be used to build up date-dimensions.

The table contains all dates from 01.01.2000 (`2000-01-01`) until 31.12.2030 (`2030-12-31`).
